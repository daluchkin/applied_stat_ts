# Applied statistics: Time series analysis

These are ["my personal learning notes"](https://daluchkin.github.io/applied_stat_ts/), created while listening to the online lecture series ["Time Series Analysis"](https://www.youtube.com/@%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/playlists) by [Boris Demeshev](https://github.com/bdemeshev). The lectures are a remarkable resource for understanding the fundamentals and practical applications of time series analysis.

I believe this lecture series deserves far more views and likes than it currently has, given its clarity, depth, and accessibility. These notes are primarily for my own learning, but I hope they may also serve as a guide or inspiration for others exploring this fascinating subject.
